Ram has just completed ESC101 and has never worked with trees before, so he wants to start from BST .


Help him write a program which uses the concept of BST to find the maximum and minimum element in the data set given in pre-order format .



A tree is a nonlinear data structure. One of its types is binary search tree.
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
	
  
  •	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
	
  
  •	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
	
  
  •	The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

INPUT:-
 

ai element in pre order format .      Where      1<i<N.
    Where  1<N<5001  

 Where each  0<ai <100000000

Output :-
Print maximum and minimum element in the list .
   
Example 1:
Input 
6
10 5 1 7 40 50

Output
50
1


Example 2:
Input 
4
45 25 15 35 75

Output 
45
15
